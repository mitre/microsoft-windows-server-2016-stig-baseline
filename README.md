# microsoft-windows-server-2016-stig-baseline

InSpec profile to validate the secure configuration of Microsoft Windows Server 2016, against [DISA](https://iase.disa.mil/stigs/)'s **Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) Version 1, Release 7**.

## Getting Started  
It is intended and recommended that InSpec run this profile from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __winrm__.

__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ 

Latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

## Running This Profile

    inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/stig-microsoft-windows-server-2016-v1r4-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz -t winrm://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --reporter cli json:<filename>.json

Runs this profile over winrm to the host at IP address <hostip> as a privileged user account (i.e., an account with administrative privileges), reporting results to both the command line interface (cli) and to a machine-readable JSON file. 
    
The following is an example of using this command. 

    inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/stig-microsoft-windows-server-2016-v1r4-baselinearchive/master.tar.gz -t winrm://$winhostip --user 'Administrator' --password=Pa55w0rd --reporter cli json:win-2016-server-results.json

## Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://mitre.github.io/heimdall-lite/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. 

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __full heimdall server__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.
